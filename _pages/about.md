I created this page with the intent of sharing Python information between computational scientists and computer scientists. The intention is firstly to help scientists and programmers who are new to using Python get up to speed quickly with information that is specific to the scientfic, and particularly, high performance computing domain. Secondly, to share information between nore experienced users in this community.

If this site is useful to you, please give me a **star** on the [github](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/python-for-hpc) page.

Please send me any good links, blog entries or other contributions (or make a pull request). 

This page was created with the support of the [IDEAS-ECP](https://ideas-productivity.org/ideas-ecp/) project and [Better Scientific Software](https://bssw.io/) initiative.
