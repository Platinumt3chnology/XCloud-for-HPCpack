What is SciPy?
--------------

[SciPy](https://www.scipy2020.scipy.org/) is a conference that focuses on how
Python is being used in scientific applications across many disciplines. It is
now in its 19th year and like Python, has been growing rapidly. Most speakers
and presenters provide links to their public code and make their
talks/resources publicly available. SciPy has a very open and welcoming
atmosphere.

SciPy will take place in Austin, TX from July 6-12, 2020. The first two days
are tutorials, the following three days are the main conference proceedings,
and the last two days are open source project sprint sessions.


Why should you come?
--------------------

This year the organizers have added two new
[tracks](https://www.scipy2020.scipy.org/talk-poster-presentations)-- High
Performance Python and Machine Learning and Data Science (of course!).

Andreas Kloeckner and I will be the co-chairs for the High Performance Python
track. We hope that it will serve as a gathering place for the growing Python
HPC community to exchange ideas, resources, and to get to know each other. We
are making an effort to reach out to Python users in many communities,
including DOE, NSF, academic institutions, and industry. You can help us by
spreading the word!

Here are some topics we will highlight during the track

* Python performance optimization
* Strategies to run Python at large scale
* Methods to enable Python on many diverse architectures, especially GPUs

Submission information
----------------------

We encourage anyone who is interested to submit a talk (25 mins) or a poster.
If selected for a talk, the authors will have the option to write a paper in
the open source conference proceedings. Here is a
[link](https://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2019/) to the 2019
proceedings.

The deadline for submissions is February 11, 2020. If you have any questions or
comments, please reach out to me at lastephey@lbl.gov or Andreas Kloeckner at
andreask@illinois.edu. We look forward to meeting our fellow HPC Python
enthusiasts!
